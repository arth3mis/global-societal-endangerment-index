# Developing a Composite Index

**Global Societal Endangerment Index (GSEI)**: A composite index to measure the vulnerability of countries to environmental, political, social, economic, and global risks and threats. These risks are weighted regarding their impact on society and population in each country. More imminent impact can be in form of catastrophes, conflicts or other severe societal shocks, while slower consequences are also taken into account, e.g. increased mortality or instability.
